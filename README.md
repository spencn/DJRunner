# DJRunner
 Final University project, done in a group of 3. Rythm game using "RythmTool" on the marketplace

I do not claim to have written all the code in this repo. Most have been contributed by my 2 fantastic team members. Code that I focused on was the direct connection with reading and utilizing the RythmTool.
